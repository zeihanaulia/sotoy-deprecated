So, I want to create another Ebook Reader for android, I need gdrive storage, to store my ebook files.
For now, I choose Kotlin as the main programing language for android. What's the story about this app.

- As a reader I want to see a list of Ebooks on My Device, So I can open and read them.
- As a reader, I want to highlight some interesting words.
- As a reader, I need a search file, because my file too much on my device.

So, thats the minimum feature I need to work.

## Feature

1. Reading pdf and epub files
2. Searching By Name
3. Word Higlighting
 
## Gather Resources
